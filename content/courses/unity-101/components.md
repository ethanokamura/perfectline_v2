## What Are Components
As previously discussed, components are essentially all the pieces that make up an object! Every object in the game contains at least a transform component. The transform component holds data such as the object's position, rotation, and scale. For example, the `Main Camera` contains both a `Camera` component and an `Audio Listener`. Typically the components are pretty self-explanatory. An example of some components that a play may have would be a `Collider` that detects an in-game collision, a script that holds the code that controls the player, and possibly a component that controls physics.

## Add A Component
To create or add a component go to the GameObject you want to add it to and look at the inspector. Here there is an `Add Component` button. You can either navigate the folders of components organized by subject or look for a specific component using the search bar.
