## About Me
A little about me: my name is Ethan Okamura. I am a computer science major with the end goal of obtaining a master's degree alongside practical experience in software engineering. As the creator of PerfectLine, I aim to be a mentor and teacher, providing affordable resources for people of all backgrounds. With a decade of programming expertise and a background in teaching, my goal is to instill a love for programming in anyone who wants to take these courses while they have fun creating their dream projects. I am committed to the continuous journey of learning and higher education and strive to offer my students comprehensive knowledge and support.

## End Goal
My goal with these lessons and courses is to offer a personalized learning experience. When I was young, I taught myself how to program but took many wrong steps and skipped over important topics. Now that I am older, more experienced, and have succeeded in structured college courses within this field, I am prepared to share my experiences and knowledge with others to help them learn to code efficiently and effectively. With two years of teaching experience, I have worked with students of all ages and backgrounds. I am prepared to work with anyone who has an interest in programming or wants to express themselves creatively. I believe programming is not just a hobby but also a healthy, beneficial, and practical skill.

Regarding my teaching style, I strongly believe in learning by doing. Throughout my life, I have been a hands-on learner, and I find this approach works best for myself and many other creatively inclined individuals, especially younger students. I find long, drawn-out lectures challenging. To address this, I offer project-based courses where students learn a topic and immediately put it into practice. Through repetition and practice, students quickly grasp everything they need to know to succeed in the future. I aim to inspire students to continue their programming journey even after they have completed their time with me.
