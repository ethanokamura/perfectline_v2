## Programming Fundamentals with C++
C++ is a widely used language that applies to most programs and is highly sought after in the job market. Despite its initial reputation as a daunting language, when taught effectively, it can lead to excellent long-term results. 

I draw on my experiences in college with C++ to guide students through the basics of general programming using C++. By acquiring fundamental knowledge of variables and algorithms in C++, students can seamlessly transition into game design, specifically utilizing the Unity engine.

```cpp
// helloworld.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

## Game Development with Unity
Game design empowers you to express yourself through programming, graphic design, and sound design, by creating a highly engaging learning experience. Unity's exceptional error report system facilitates the identification and resolution of errors, enabling students to learn from their mistakes and refine their games.

I reccomend you dedicate ample time to exploring Unity and C# concepts. Furthermore, Unity allows for the conversion of games to WebGL, which facilitates the embedding of games in websites. This opens the door to exploring topics such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, creating a seamless transition to web development.

```cs
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class basic_script : MonoBehaviour {
	// Start is called first frame if the script is enabled.
	void Start()
  {

  }

	// Update updates every frame.
	void Update()
  {

  }
}
```

## End Goal
My goal with these lessons and courses is to offer a personalized learning experience. When I was young, I taught myself how to program but took many wrong steps and skipped over important topics. Now that I am older, more experienced, and have succeeded in structured college courses within this field, I am prepared to share my experiences and knowledge with others to help them learn to code efficiently and effectively. With two years of teaching experience, I have worked with students of all ages and backgrounds. I am prepared to work with anyone who has an interest in programming or wants to express themselves creatively. I believe programming is not just a hobby but also a healthy, beneficial, and practical skill.

Regarding my teaching style, I strongly believe in learning by doing. Throughout my life, I have been a hands-on learner, and I find this approach works best for myself and many other creatively inclined individuals, especially younger students. I find long, drawn-out lectures challenging. To address this, I offer project-based courses where students learn a topic and immediately put it into practice. Through repetition and practice, students quickly grasp everything they need to know to succeed in the future. I aim to inspire students to continue their programming journey even after they have completed their time with me.
