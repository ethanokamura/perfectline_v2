## Teaching Style
I recommend that all new programmers follow the curriculum path I have set up. To begin, we cover an introduction to programming through C++ and progress into game development using C# and Unity (a game engine). Once we complete our first game, we transition to web design, allowing students to have a platform to host their games. This enables friends and family to see their progress remotely. By progressing through these three steps, students acquire a comprehensive skill set in software development. Starting with the fundamentals of programming in C++, transitioning to game development with Unity and C#, and culminating in web development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, our online teaching service offers a seamless and rewarding learning journey.

## 01: Introduction to Programming with C++
In this first step of our online teaching service, we provide students with a solid foundation in programming through an introductory course in C++. C++ is a widely used language that applies to most programs and is highly sought after in the job market. Despite its initial reputation as a daunting language, when taught effectively, it can lead to excellent long-term results. During this step, I draw on my experiences in college with C++ to guide students through the basics of general programming using C++. By acquiring fundamental knowledge of variables and algorithms in C++, students can seamlessly transition into game design, specifically utilizing the Unity engine.

Throughout our time together, I assign challenge problems with C++ for students to work on outside the lessons, allowing them to practice and reinforce their programming skills.

## 02: Game Development with C# and Unity
Building upon the student's understanding of C++ from Step 1, we delve into the exciting world of game development using C# in conjunction with the Unity game engine. As the instructor, this section is my favorite due to its interactive nature and immediate results.

Game design empowers students to express themselves through programming, graphic design, and sound design, creating a highly engaging learning experience. Unity's exceptional error report system facilitates the identification and resolution of errors, enabling students to learn from their mistakes and refine their games.

This step represents the most intensive part of the lessons, as we dedicate ample time to exploring Unity and C# concepts. Furthermore, Unity allows for the conversion of games to WebGL, which facilitates the embedding of games in websites. This opens the door to exploring topics such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, creating a seamless transition to web development.

## 03: Web Development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
In the final step of our online teaching service, we guide students through the realm of web development, focusing on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Students will actively work on creating and enhancing their websites, including a dedicated page where they can showcase their games and overall progress.

By using HTML and CSS, students will learn to create visually appealing and interactive web pages. JavaScript further enriches the web development experience by enabling students to make their websites more dynamic and responsive.

This step serves as an excellent opportunity for students to demonstrate their accomplishments to both their peers and parents through the personalized pages they design and create. Additionally, it equips students with essential skills in creating modern-day web applications and websites, such as JavaScript is a sought-after programming language for software engineers.
