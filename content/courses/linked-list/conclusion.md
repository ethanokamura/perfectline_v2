We have finally gotten to a good stopping point. However, there might be some more functions that you might want to add like a way to print out our list.

We will not get into that in this course, but those functions are available in the source code for this project! [here](https://github.com/ethanokamura/dsa/blob/main/linked-list/cpp/linked_list/linked_list.h).

I hope you found this helpful. Linked lists are a crucial topic to understand. Lots of data structures use linked lists behind the scenes. They can be very fast and having a custom structure can be very useful!

The next recommended course will be the Data Structures and Algorithms course (DSA). Found [here](https://perfectline.io/courses/cpp/dsa/intro).
