## What is C++?
C++ is a statically typed, multi-paradigm, procedural, object-oriented, generic, functional language.

1. **Statically typed**: the type of a variable is known at compile time. For C++ this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is. (more on types later).
2. **Multi-Paradigm**: There are many features and ways of going about solving problems!
3. **Procedural**: functions in a step-by-step process
4. **Object Oriented**: We can define _custom types_ (classes or structs) with members that are either _properties_ (variables) or _actions_ (functions)
5. **Generic**: We write code that applies broadly to many different data types.
6. **Functional**: We compose programs by writing functions that call other functions

C++ is known for its efficiency, performance, versatility, and widespread use in software infrastructure. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s as an extension of the C programming language, adding object-oriented features. C++ is a superset of the language C - meaning that virtually any C program is a valid C++. The language provides low-level memory and hardware control like its predecessor C, but with high-level features like classes and smart pointers.

C++ can create pretty much anything! Here are a couple of examples of popular software built with C++:
  1. Game engines (Unreal Engine)
  2. Desktop software (Adobe Products)
  3. Databases (MySQL)
  4. Embedded systems (displays in your car or on your appliances)
  5. Used to implement much of our low-level infrastructure like language compilers and virtual machines

It is, however, also known for its steep learning curve and unforgiving syntax.
